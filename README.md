## Features

- **Adaptive Navbar** — IntersectionObserver on `#top` detects hero visibility; toggles text/background between light (hero) and dark (rest of page); "Start a project" button turns orange (`ember`) when hero is in view
- **Draggable Gallery** — framer-motion drag with momentum, 3D tilt per card via `useTransform`, seamless loop via duplicated track (51 images), auto-scroll pauses on drag
- **GSAP Scroll-Triggered** — photography section fades in from grayscale to color; design section unblurs on scroll
- **CountUp** — custom React component using `requestAnimationFrame` with cubic ease-out, triggered by IntersectionObserver at 30% threshold
- **Mad Libs Form** — inline inputs form a sentence: "I'm [name] at [email], looking for [service] with a budget of [budget]" — mock submit with alert
- **Smooth Scrolling** — `scroll-behavior: smooth`, `scroll-padding-top: 5rem` on `<html>`

## Image Assets

All images served from `public/assets/`:

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `public/assets/hero/` | `demo 11.jpg`–`36.jpg` (26 images for draggable gallery) |
| `public/assets/` | `demo 1.jpg`–`10.jpg` (photography & design), `japan.jpg` (about backdrop), `footer 2.jpg` (footer bg) |

Images with spaces in filenames require CSS `url("...")` quoting when referenced as `backgroundImage`.

## Theme

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | `#0b0b0b` | Dark background, text on hero |
| `cream` | `#f7f7f5` | Light text on dark, hero background |
| `ember` | `#d4783b` | Accent / CTA button |

## Architecture

Single-file app in `src/routes/index.tsx` (~850 lines). All components — Intro loader, Hero gallery, Stats counters, Photography grid, Design grid, About section, and Footer form — live in one file. No state management library; local `useState` / `useRef` / IntersectionObserver patterns.

Key dependencies:
- **GSAP** (`gsap`, `@gsap/react`, `gsap/ScrollTrigger`) — photography grayscale animation, design blur animation, intro loader exit
- **framer-motion** (`motion`, `useMotionValue`, `useSpring`, `useTransform`, `animate`) — draggable gallery, 3D tilt, auto-scroll marquee loop
- **Radix Select** (`@radix-ui/react-select`) — contact form dropdowns
